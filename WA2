 Determine the number of protein sequences in the chloroplast.
    RESULT: 85 sequences
Create a file of all of the names of protein sequences in Coffee plant's chloroplast sequences.
How many photosystem subunits are present in the chromosome?
Make a .fasta file with the sequences for ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit protein sequence.
